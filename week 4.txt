1. INSERT Statement
The INSERT statement allows you to add new records (rows) into a table.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
Example:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO expenses (category, department, amount, date)
VALUES ('Travel', 'Sales', 350.00, '2024-11-06');
This query adds a new expense record to the expenses table with specific values for category, department, amount, and date.

2. UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Example:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE expenses
SET amount = 400.00
WHERE id = 5;
This query updates the amount for the record where id equals 5 in the expenses table.

Note: Always use the WHERE clause when updating records to avoid updating all rows unintentionally.

3. DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM expenses
WHERE id = 5;
This query deletes the record from the expenses table where the id is 5.

Note: Be careful when using DELETE without a WHERE clause, as it will remove all records from the table.

4. Handling NULL Values
NULL represents missing, undefined, or unknown data in a database. You can insert, update, and filter for NULL values in queries.

Inserting NULL Values:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO expenses (category, department, amount, date)
VALUES ('Travel', 'Sales', NULL, '2024-11-06');
This inserts a record with a NULL value for the amount column.

Updating NULL Values:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE expenses
SET amount = NULL
WHERE id = 5;
This sets the amount field to NULL for the record with id 5.

Filtering NULL Values:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM expenses
WHERE amount IS NULL;
This query retrieves all records where the amount is NULL.

Example Scenarios:
Add New Entry:

Imagine you need to add a new expense for the Marketing department. You would use the INSERT statement.
Update Existing Record:

If the expense in the Travel category has been revised, you can use the UPDATE statement to adjust the amount.
Delete Unwanted Record:

If an incorrect expense record was entered, you can delete it using the DELETE statement.
Practice:
Use INSERT to add a few entries to your expenses table.
Use UPDATE to modify some values, like changing the amount for a specific record.
Use DELETE to remove a record from your table.
Practice handling NULL values by inserting and filtering them.
